##What is it?
Pi is a library written in Go for using the raspberry pi's GPIO pins.
It's based off [WiringPi](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi).

##Cool, how do I get it?
First you must [install WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/)

```shell
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
cd wiringPi
./build
```

Then download this to your $GOPATH
